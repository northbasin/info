# Native Shoreline Plants

The native shoreline plants appear to have all colonized the area naturally. They are less impacted by invasives since most invasives are not able to survive the saline bay environment. Below is a list of native shoreline plants present as of June 2025 in (very roughly) decreasing order of abundance.

<a id="saltgrass"></a>

## _Distichlis spicata_ (saltgrass)

The most abundant and widespread of the shoreline plants. It is present on the shoreline along the entire project area. In the [Living Shoreline section](../../../project_sections/living_shoreline), it has stabilized significant sections of the unarmored landfill and extends into the upland in some areas. Along the Virginia Street Extension, there are patches of saltgrass on the south side of the road near the meadow fence. In the northern panhandle, there are large areas of saltgrass east of pavement, below the sports field riprap.

<a id="pickleweed"></a>

## _Salicornia pacifica_ (pickleweed)

Pickleweed is common in all the shoreline sections. It appears only in the lower sections that are regularly exposed to tides.
