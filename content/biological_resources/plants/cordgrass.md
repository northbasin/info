# California cordgrass (_Sporobolus foliosus_, formerly _Spartina foliosa_)

**_Note: As of 2025-06-06, the documents on the [project website](https://www.ebparks.org/projects/north-basin-strip-shoreline-improvement-project-berkeley) still refer to this as hybrid cordgrass (Spartina foliosa x alterniflora). The cordgrass in the project area was DNA sampled by the Invasive Spartina Project in October 2024 and confirmed to be native Sporobolus foliosus (formerly Spartina foliosa)._**

Cordgrass around the bay is monitored by the [Invasive Spartina Project](https://spartina.org/) to ensure that invasive hybrid cordgrass does not spread and alter shoreline ecosystems.

Cordgrass grows at the lower end of the intertidal zone, in a very narrow elevation range. A small patch of cordgrass has been present in a small depression in the gravel beach area since at least 2011. This patch has not changed significantly in size.

In late 2018, a small patch of cordgrass appeared along the living shoreline section. It was approximately 1 foot square when first documented. As of June 2025, this patch has expanded to approximately 40 feet along the length of the shoreline, and approximately 15 feet wide at its widest point.

In approximately 2021, several other small patches appeared along the living shoreline section and are slowly expanding.
