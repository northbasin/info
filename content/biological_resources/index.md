## iNaturalist

iNaturalist contains crowdsourced observations and identifications of [organisms in the project area](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?acc_below_or_unknown=50&nelat=37.878037746326655&nelng=-122.30509857697258&subview=map&swlat=37.868823464477764&swlng=-122.3147545294262&view=species).

Many organisms are difficult to identify accurately, particularly with only a photograph, so any unusual identifications bear further investigation. For common, easily identifiable organisms iNaturalist can give a good indication of abundance and distribution. The link above includes the entire project area, as well as some areas adjacent to the project. Links in the [project section pages](../project_sections) cover smaller sections.
