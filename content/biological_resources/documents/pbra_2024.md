# Preliminary Biological Resources Assessment

A Preliminary Biological Resources Assessment memorandum was published on August 27, 2024 by [Environmental Science Associates](https://esassoc.com/). This preliminary assessment was based on a review of existing documents and a "reconnaissance-level survey of the project area on June 6, 2024".

## Clarifications and Corrections

p. 4 - "A sand and gravel spit along the east edge of the North Basin includes limited areas of non-native, invasive smooth cordgrass (_Spartina alterniflora_)". This has been identified as native cordgrass - [see details](../../plants/cordgrass/).

p. 4 - "The western edge of North Basin Strip between the path and escarpment ... includes some non-native cultivars". There do not appear to be cultivars in this location except possibly _Oenothera_ (see below). There are a few plants which may be considered non-native as they are California natives not likely to occur naturally in nearby habitat. Specific detail on what are considered non-native cultivars would be helpful.

p. 4 - "including the very common, non-native yellow-faced bumble bee (_Bombus vosnesenskii_)". This species seems to generally be considered a local native, so either a correction or information about why it is considered non-native should be supplied.

p. 5 - _Brassica nigra_ does not appear to be present in the project area.

p. 5 - The _Diplacus_ in the project area is likely all _Diplacus aurantiacus_, a species native to the East Bay, planted since 2015 and occasionally reseeding from these plantings. _Diplacus longiflorus_ does not appear to be present in the project area.
