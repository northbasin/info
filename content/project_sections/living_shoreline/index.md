# Living Shoreline / Scarp Reach

The Living Shoreline section is the shoreline segment south of the sports fields and north of the Virginia Street Extension. It is the only section of fill that was not armored with [riprap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riprap). Because of this, native salt marsh vegetation, particularly saltgrass (_Distichlis spicata_) has been able to colonize the base of the fill in many places and gradually spread to help stabilize the slope.

The condition of the shoreline varies in this section from fully stabilized slopes ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/section-15-JdusaBK)) to 5 foot high scarps (cliffs) and everything in between these extremes. In this section, the unarmored scarp is gradually converted to living shoreline when small patches of saltgrass become established at or below the base of the scarp ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/ci9d1Qj)). The saltgrass migrates both along the shoreline from north to south, gradually filling in the gaps, and up the slope to gradually eliminate the scarp ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/transition-from-scarp-to-living-shoreline-dCaiCgg)). Sections with little or no saltgrass at the base of the scarp can be subject to significant [erosion](./erosion) under some conditions.

## Current Shoreline Conditions

For a sample of the varied conditions along the shoreline, see the following posts:

- [Saltgrass slope with no scarp](https://imgur.com/a/section-15-JdusaBK)
- [The longest section of unstabilized scarp](https://imgur.com/a/section-21-sX5HpKs) (approximately 30 meters)
- [Living shoreline section that has formed recently](https://imgur.com/a/section-22-dCaiCgg) and is evolving from full scarp to stable slope
- [Short section of scarp where adjacent slope sections have nearly met at the base](https://imgur.com/a/QUZDWXs)

For full details, there is a [Google Earth map](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/19X_4ccPgND-m5bCVRNyiqcisJ5fFyXJm?usp=sharing) showing the condition of all portions of this section. Click on the colored segments to see more detailed description, approximate length, and links to photos.

- The green sections have no scarp.
- The orange sections have stable saltgrass at the base. Some scarp remains; conditions vary from almost no scarp to substantial scarp. Click on the segment for more details.
- The red sections are mostly scarp with little or no well-established saltgrass near the base. Click on the segment for more details of each section.

## Plants

The dominant plant along the Living Shoreline is [saltgrass](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#saltgrass) (_Distichlis spicata_). Once the saltgrass becomes abundant enough to stabilize the slope, patches of [pickleweed](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#pickleweed) and [gumplant](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#gumplant) appear in the saltgrass.

In 2018, a small patch of [California cordgrass](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#cordgrass) (_Sporobolus foliosus_, formerly _Spartina foliosa_) appeared along the shoreline in this section. It may have originated from the small patch in the [Gravel Beach](../gravel_beach) section. Since then the patch that started in 2018 has expanded slowly, and several other patches have appeared and are expanding.
