# Living Shoreline / Scarp Reach

The Living Shoreline section is the shoreline segment south of the sports fields and north of the Virginia Street Extension. It is the only section of fill that was not armored with [riprap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riprap). Because of this, native salt marsh vegetation, particularly saltgrass (_Distichlis spicata_) was able to colonize the base of the fill and gradually spread inland, creating a stable slope that does not erode and can migrate inland as sea level rises.

The condition of the shoreline varies in this section from fully stabilized slopes ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/section-15-JdusaBK)) to 5 foot high scarps (cliffs) and everything in between these extremes (slopes of saltgrass at the base of shorter scarps). In this section, the unarmored scarp is gradually converted to living shoreline when small patches of saltgrass become established at or below the base of the scarp ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/ci9d1Qj)). The saltgrass migrates both along the shoreline from north to south, gradually filling in the gaps, and up the slope to gradually eliminate the scarp ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/transition-from-scarp-to-living-shoreline-dCaiCgg)). Sections with little or no saltgrass at the base of the scarp can be subject to significant [erosion](./erosion) under some conditions.

## Plants

The dominant plant along the Living Shoreline is [saltgrass](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#saltgrass) (_Distichlis spicata_). Once the saltgrass becomes abundant enough to stabilize the slope, patches of [pickleweed](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#pickleweed) and [gumplant](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#gumplant) appear in the saltgrass.

In 2018, a small patch of [California cordgrass](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#cordgrass) (_Sporobolus foliosus_, formerly _Spartina foliosa_) appeared along the shoreline in this section. It may have originated from the small patch in the [Gravel Beach](../gravel_beach) section. Since then the patch that started in 2018 has expanded slowly, and several other patches have appeared and are expanding.
