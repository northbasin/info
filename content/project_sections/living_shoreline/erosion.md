# Erosion in the Living Shoreline Section

The condition of the shoreline varies in this section from slopes fully stabilized by saltgrass, to 5 foot high scarps (cliffs), and everything in between these extremes (slopes of saltgrass at the base of shorter scarps). In this section, the unarmored scarp is gradually converted to living shoreline when small patches of saltgrass become established at or below the base of the scarp. The saltgrass migrates both along the shoreline from north to south, gradually filling in the gaps, and up the slope to gradually eliminate the scarp. Sections with little or no saltgrass at the base of the scarp can be subject to significant erosion under some conditions.

The sections that are fully or mostly colonized by saltgrass slope show no erosion, even during extreme events like the King Tide/storm surge in December 2024. The scarp sections will erode in various ways. Some of this erosion is necessary to form the slope.

- If the base of the scarp has a significant saltgrass slope, the scarp at the top of the slope gradually erodes and becomes shorter. As long as it doesn't get smothered by a large amount of erosion, the top of the scarp retreats inland and the saltgrass spreads up through the scarp slump until the scarp eventually disappears, and the saltgrass then migrates significantly inland.
- If the scarp is undisturbed, it usually does not erode significantly. The base of the scarp is regularly exposed to high tides, so they typically erode to a point where they are relatively stable, and the usual tides (including King Tides) do not have much impact. In the absence of disturbance, the scarps gradually become stabilized by saltgrass from adjacent stabilized slopes.
- If the scarp is disturbed, significant erosion can occur. Information about [causes of erosion](#causes) is below.

For full details, there is a [Google Earth map](https://earth.google.com/earth/d/19X_4ccPgND-m5bCVRNyiqcisJ5fFyXJm?usp=sharing) showing the condition of all portions of this section. Click on the colored segments to see more detailed description, approximate length, and links to photos.

- The green sections have no scarp.
- The orange sections have stable saltgrass at the base. Some scarp remains; conditions vary from almost no scarp to substantial scarp. Click on the segment for more details.
- The red sections are mostly scarp with little or no well-established saltgrass near the base. Click on the segment for more details of each section.

## Causes of Erosion

### Vandalism

People sometimes excavate the scarp sections looking for treasures (glass bottles seem to be the primary target). When this occurs, the soil is loosened and washes away more easily, undercutting the scarp and making it more likely to collapse. If there are small amounts of saltgrass on the scarp face or at the base of the scarp they are usually destroyed. Saltgrass advancing from adjacent sections often damaged by digging in the scarp.

### Foot Traffic

The shoreline is often used as a shortcut to and from trails in the upland area. Slopes fully colonized with saltgrass can handle a small amount of foot traffic, but full or partial scarp sections are generally subject to increased erosion and damage to the adjacent saltgrass if they are used for access.

### Storm Surge

Slopes that are fully colonized by saltgrass, with no scarp, do not typically show any erosion, even during wind-driven tides high tides. During a "normal" high tide, without much wave action, little erosion occurs even on the undisturbed scarp sections. Wind-driven high tides may be higher than usual, and can cause significant erosion, particularly to areas that have been damaged by human activity.

### Vegetation

Some large plants (particularly coyote brush and [gumplant](../../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#gumplant)) occasionally grow on the scarp face or at the top of the scarp. If they grow large enough, they can collapse part of the scarp, particular at high tides which soak the edge of the scarp.

### Ground Squirrels

Ground squirrels are common in the upland area. If they dig near the scarp face, it can speed up erosion.
