# Erosion in the Living Shoreline / Scarp Section

The condition of the shoreline varies widely in the Living Shoreline section. The sections that are fully or mostly colonized by saltgrass slope show no erosion, even during extreme events like the King Tide wind waves in December 2024. The scarp sections will erode in various ways. Some of this erosion is necessary to form the slope.

- If the base of the scarp has a significant saltgrass slope, the scarp at the top of the slope gradually erodes and becomes shorter. As long as it doesn't get smothered by a large amount of erosion, the top of the scarp retreats inland and the saltgrass spreads up through the scarp slump until the scarp eventually disappears, and the saltgrass then migrates significantly inland.
- If the scarp is undisturbed, it usually does not erode significantly. The base of the scarp is regularly exposed to high tides, so they typically erode to a point where they are relatively stable, and the usual tides (including King Tides) do not have much impact. In the absence of disturbance, the scarps gradually become stabilized by saltgrass from adjacent stabilized slopes.
- If the scarp is disturbed, significant erosion can occur. Information about [causes of erosion](#causes) is below.

## Causes of Erosion

### Vandalism

People sometimes excavate the scarp sections looking for treasures (glass bottles seem to be the primary target). When this occurs, the soil is loosened and washes away more easily, undercutting the scarp and making it more likely to collapse. If there are small amounts of saltgrass on the scarp face or at the base of the scarp they are usually destroyed. Saltgrass advancing from adjacent sections is often damaged by digging in the scarp.

### Foot Traffic

The shoreline is often used as a shortcut to and from trails in the upland area. Slopes fully colonized with saltgrass can handle a small amount of foot traffic, but full or partial scarp sections are generally subject to increased erosion and damage to the adjacent saltgrass if they are used for access.

### High Tides and Wind Waves

Slopes that are fully colonized by saltgrass, with no scarp, do not typically show any erosion, even during wind-driven high tides. During a "normal" high tide, without much wave action, little erosion occurs even on the undisturbed scarp sections. Wind-driven high tides may be higher than usual, and can cause significant erosion, particularly to areas that have been damaged by human activity.

### Vegetation

Some large plants (particularly coyote brush and [gumplant](../../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#gumplant)) occasionally grow on the scarp face or at the top of the scarp. If they grow large enough, they can collapse part of the scarp, particularly at high tides which soak the edge of the scarp. Vegetation on a saltgrass slope is typically not a problem; once the slope is established, gumplant and other shoreline plants begin appearing on the slope without causing erosion.

### Ground Squirrels

Ground squirrels are common in the upland area. If they dig near the scarp face, it can speed up erosion.
