# Project Sections

Project documents generally refer to five distinct project sections.

## [Road Reach / Northern Panhandle](./north_panhandle)

The narrow northern section between the sports fields and the bay.

## [Living Shoreline / Scarp Reach](./living_shoreline)

Usually referred to as "Scarp Reach" in the project documents, this is the section of shoreline between the south end of the sports fields and the Virginia Street extension.

## [Gravel Beach](./gravel_beach)

The gravel beach is a small area at the south end of the Living Shoreline / Scarp Reach where a small but botanically diverse salt marsh has formed.

## Virginia Street Extension

## Inland / Grasslands / Woodland / Scrub
