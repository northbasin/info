# Gravel Beach

The Gravel Beach section is the section just north of the Virginia Street Extension, where the shoreline has a small salt marsh before the transition to uplands.

## Plants

The gravel beach marsh is small, but it is the most botanically diverse shoreline section in the project.

Beginning in 2023, [beach saltbush](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#saltbush) (uncommon in the East Bay) has been appearing occasionally at the edges of the gravel beach.
