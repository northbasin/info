# Northern Panhandle / Road Reach

The Northern Panhandle section is the northernmost section of the project, just south of Gilman Street. It is a narrow stretch extending south to the end of the sports fields, and east from the shoreline to the western edge of the sports fields.

The central north-south section has little vegetation. The northern part was paved in late 2024. The southern part is a mix of packed dirt, gravel, and old asphalt.

## Plants

The shoreline area is primarily shallow, sparse riprap mixed with mostly native shoreline plants at the lower elevations, with increasing amounts of invasive non-native plants in the upper elevations. The native shoreline vegetation is diverse, including most of the [shoreline plants](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline) found in the project area. The northern segment of shoreline in this section is covered with slabs of concrete and has no native shoreline vegetation.

Beginning in 2023, [beach saltbush](../../biological_resources/plants/shoreline#saltbush) (uncommon in the East Bay) has been appearing occasionally along the shoreline in this section.

On the east side of the panhandle, there are some large patches of saltgrass below the riprap.
